The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations within CSS. However, if you use it incorrectly, especially with spaces or operators, it can lead to unexpected results. For instance, `width: calc(100% - 20px)` works fine, but `width: calc(100% - 20 px)` will likely fail because of the space between `20` and `px`. Another common issue is forgetting to wrap complex calculations in parentheses, which can change the order of operations and lead to wrong results.
