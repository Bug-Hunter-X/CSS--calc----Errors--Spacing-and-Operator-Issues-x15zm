The `calc()` function requires careful attention to spacing and operator precedence.  Ensure there are no spaces between the numbers and units (e.g., `20px` not `20 px`) and use parentheses to explicitly define the order of operations for complex calculations. For example:

```css
/* Incorrect */
width: calc(100% - 20 px); /* Space between 20 and px */
height: calc(50% + 10px * 2); /* Incorrect order of operations */

/* Correct */
width: calc(100% - 20px);
height: calc(50% + (10px * 2));
```
Always test your `calc()` expressions thoroughly to prevent unexpected layout problems.
